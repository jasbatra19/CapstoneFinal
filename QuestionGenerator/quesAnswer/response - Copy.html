     <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">1. What is a Data Structure?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:-  Data structure is a way that specifies how to organize and manipulate the data so that the data can be used efficiently. It also specify the relationship between them. Some example of data structure are - array, linked list, stack etc. 
        </p>
        </p> <br/>
        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">2. What are linear and non linear data Structures?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:-<br/><br/>
        <b>Linear Data Structure:</b>  If all the elements are arranged in sequential order then it is called linear data strucutre for example Array, Linked List. <br/>
        <b>Non Linear Data Structure</b> If the elements are not arranged in sequential order then it is called non linear data structure for example Tree, Graph. 
        </p>
        </p> <br/>
        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">3. How Linked list is different from array?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:-  Differences between array and linked list are - <br/>
        1)&nbsp; Arrays are index based data structure where each element is associated with an index. On the other hand, Linked list relies on references where each node consists of the data and the references to the previous and next element.<br/>
        2)&nbsp; The size of the arrays is fixed, Linked Lists are Dynamic in size.<br/>
        3)&nbsp; In array elements are accessed randomly using index while in linked list elements are accessed in sequence.<br/>
        4)&nbsp; Insertion and Deletion operations are expensive in array whereas it can be easily done in linked list.<br/>
        5)&nbsp; Extra memory space is required in linked list for storing address of next node.<br/>
        6)&nbsp; Element location is allocated during compile time in array while in linked list it is done during run time.<br/>

        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">10. What is a queue in data-structure?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:-  Queue is a linear data structure where the elements are inserted from one end called REAR and deleted from the other end called as FRONT. It follow First In First Out (FIFO) i.e the first element that is added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
        </p>
        </p> <br/>
        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">11. How to implement a stack using queue?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:-  Stack can be implemented using 2 queues. To push an item in the stack, we first move all elements from the first queue to the second queue, then push new item into the first queue, and finally move all elements back to the first queue. This ensures that the new item lies at front of the queue and hence would be the first one to be removed. To pop an item from the stack, we simply return the front item from the first queue.

        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">12. What is Brute Force algorithm?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:-  Brute force means that you will go through all possible solutions extensively. For example, in a chess game, if you know you can win in two moves, the brute force will go through all possible combination of moves, without taking anything in consideration. So the little pawn in the back that cannot influence the outcome will still be considered.

        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">2. Major Differences between JAVA and C++?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:- There are lot of differences, some of the major differences are:<br/><br/>
        1)&nbsp; C++ is mainly used for system programming.Java is mainly used for application programming. It is widely used in window, web-based, enterprise and mobile applications.<br/>
        2)&nbsp; C++ supports multiple inheritance.Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class. It can be achieved by interfaces in java.<br/>
        3)&nbsp; C++ supports pointers. You can write pointer program in C++.
        Java supports pointer internally. But you can't write the pointer program in java. It means java has restricted pointer support in java.<br/>
        4)&nbsp; C++ is platform-dependent.Java is platform-independent.<br/>
        5)&nbsp; C++ uses compiler only. C++ is compiled and run using the compiler which converts source code into machine code so, C++ is platform dependent. Java uses compiler and interpreter both. Java source code is converted into bytecode at compilation time. The interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and produces output. Java is interpreted that is why it is platform independent.<br/>
        6)&nbsp; C++ supports structures and unions.  Java doesn't support structures and unions.<br/>
        7)&nbsp; C++ doesn't support documentation comment. Java supports documentation comment (/** ... */) to create documentation for java source code.<br/>

        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">4. What do you understand by Java virtual machine?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:- JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.<br/>JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e. JVM is platform dependent).<br/><br/>
        1)&nbsp; A specification where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its implementation has been provided by Sun and other companies.<br/>
        2)&nbsp; An implementation Its implementation is known as JRE (Java Runtime Environment).<br/>
        3)&nbsp; Runtime Instance Whenever you write java command on the command prompt to run the java class, an instance of JVM is created.<br/>

        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:- Following are the differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM:<br/></br>
        &nbsp;<b> JDK </b>:-Java Development Kit is the core component of Java Environment and provides all the tools, executables and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program. JDK is a platform-specific software and that’s why we have separate installers for Windows, Mac, and Unix systems.<br/>
        &nbsp;<b> JVM </b>:-JVM is the heart of Java programming language. When we run a program, JVM is responsible for converting Byte code to the machine specific code. JVM is also platform dependent and provides core java functions like memory management, garbage collection, security etc.<br/>
        &nbsp;<b> JRE </b>:-JRE is the implementation of JVM, it provides a platform to execute java programs. JRE consists of JVM and java binaries and other classes to execute any program successfully. JRE doesn’t contain any development tools like java compiler, debugger etc. <br/> </p>

        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">6.How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:- There are six main types of memory areas that are allocated by JVM. These include:<br/><br/>
        1.&nbsp; <b>Class loader</b> – a subsystem of JVM that is used to load class files.<br/>
        2.&nbsp; <b>Class (Method) Area </b>– stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field and method data, the code for methods.<br/>
        3.&nbsp; <b> Heap </b>- is the runtime data area in which objects are allocated.<br/>
        4.&nbsp; <b>Stack </b>- stores frames and holds local variables and partial results. Participates in method invocation and return.<br/>
        5.&nbsp; <b>Program Counter (PC) Register </b>- contains the address of the JVM instruction that is currently being executed.<br/>
        6. &nbsp;<b>Native Method Stack </b>- contains all native methods used in the application.<br/>
        </p>
        </p> <br/>
        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">7. What is JIT compiler?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:- It is used to improve performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here the term “compiler� refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.</p>

        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">8. What are the main differences between the Java platform and other platforms?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:- The three major differences between Java platform and most other platforms are:<br/><br/>
        1) &nbsp;It is a software-based platform while others can be hardware based or hardware software platform.<br/>
        2)&nbsp;Java supports WORA (Write once run anywhere),which means it is platform independent, but many of other platforms does not provide such feature.<br/>
        3) &nbsp;The Java API enable users to write java program, which are converted to byte code by interpreter and then into machine language by complier, whereas other platform provide either complier or interpreter.

        </p> <br/>
        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">9. What is classloader?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:- We know that Java Program runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When we compile a Java Class, it transforms it in the form of bytecode that is platform and machine independent compiled program and stores it as a .class file. After that when we try to use a Class, Java ClassLoader loads that class into memory.<br/> 
        1)&nbsp; <b>Bootstrap Class Loader :</b>It loads JDK internal classes, typically loads rt.jar and other core classes for example java.lang.* package classes.<br/>
        2)&nbsp; <b>Extensions Class Loader :</b>It loads classes from the JDK extensions directory, usually $JAVA_HOME/lib/ext directory.<br/>
        3)&nbsp; <b>System Class Loader :</b>It loads classes from the current classpath that can be set while invoking a program using -cp or -classpath command line options.

        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">11. What are the various access specifiers in Java?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:- You must have seen public, private and protected keywords while practising java programs, these are called access modifiers. An access modifier restricts the access of a class, constructor, data member and method in another class. In java we have four access modifiers:<br/><br/>
        1)&nbsp; <b>Default</b>:When we do not mention any access modifier, it is called default access modifier. The scope of this modifier is limited to the package only. This means that if we have a class with the default access modifier in a package, only those classes that are in this package can access this class. No other class outside this package can access this class.<br/>
        2)&nbsp;<b>Private</b>:Methods, variables, and constructors that are declared private can only be accessed within the declared class itself.Private access modifier is the most restrictive access level. Class and interfaces cannot be private.Variables that are declared private can be accessed outside the class, if public getter methods are present in the class.<br/>
        3)&nbsp;<b>Public</b>:A class, method, constructor, interface, etc. declared public can be accessed from any other class. Therefore, fields, methods, blocks declared inside a public class can be accessed from any class belonging to the Java Universe.<br/>
        4)&nbsp;<b>Protected</b>:Variables, methods, and constructors, which are declared protected in a superclass can be accessed only by the subclasses in other package or any class within the package of the protected members' class.

        <p class="mcq"><span class = "ques">12. Can we Overload or Override static methods in java ?<br/></span>
        <p class = "options">
        <b>Answer</b>:-<br/><br/>
        <b>Can we overload static methods?</b>:- The answer is ‘Yes’. We can have two ore more static methods with same name, but differences in input parameters.<br/>
        <b>Can we Override static methods in java? </b>:- We can declare static methods with same signature in subclass, but it is not considered overriding as there won’t be any run-time polymorphism. Hence the answer is ‘No’. Static methods cannot be overridden because method overriding only occurs in the context of dynamic (i.e. runtime) lookup of methods. Static methods (by their name) are looked up statically (i.e. at compile-time).</p>

        <b>Answer</b>:- It is a programming paradigm based on objects having data and methods defined in the class to which it belongs. Object-oriented paradigm aims to incorporate the advantages of modularity and reusability. Objects are the instances of classes which interacts with one another to design applications and programs. There are the following features of the object-oriented paradigm.<br/><br/>
        1)&nbsp; Follows the bottom-up approach in program design.<br/>
        2)&nbsp; Focus on data with methods to operate upon the objects data<br/>
        3)&nbsp;Includes the concept like Encapsulation and abstraction which hides the complexities from the user and show only functionality.<br/>
        4)&nbsp;Implements the real-time approach like inheritance, abstraction, etc.<br/>
        5)&nbsp;The examples of the object-oriented paradigm are C++, Simula, Smalltalk, Python, C#, etc.</p>

        <b>Answer</b>:- Based on the parameters passed in the constructors, there are two types of constructors in Java.<br/><br/>
        1)&nbsp; <b>Default Constructor</b>: A Constructor with no parameters is called as Default Constructor or no-arg constructor. In the below code we have created the no-arg constructor which gets called during the time of object creation.<br/><b>Example</b>: (Abc a = new Abc())<br/>
        2)&nbsp;<b>Parameterized Constructor</b>:A Constructor which has parameters in it called as Parameterized Constructors, the Parameterized constructor is used to assign different values for the different objects.  In the below example we have a parameterized constructor for the car class which set the value for the parameter “Color� <br/>

        <b>Answer</b>:-There are the following differences between compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.<br/><br/>
        <b>compile-time polymorphism</b>:-<br/>
        1)In compile-time polymorphism, call to a method is resolved at compile-time.<br/>
        2) It is also known as static binding, early binding, or overloading.<br/>
        3) Overloading is a way to achieve compile-time polymorphism in which, we can define multiple methods or constructors with different signatures.<br/>
        4) It provides fast execution because the type of an object is determined at compile-time.<br/><br/>
        <b>Run-time polymorphism</b>:-<br/>
        1)In runtime polymorphism, call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime.<br/>
        2)It is also known as dynamic binding, late binding, overriding, or dynamic method dispatch.<br/>
        3) Overriding is a way to achieve runtime polymorphism in which, we can redefine some particular method or variable in the derived class. By using overriding, we can give some specific implementation to the base class properties in the derived class.<br/>
        4) It provides slower execution as compare to compile-time because the type of an object is determined at run-time.</p>

            <p class = "options">
            <b>Answer</b>:- near, far and huge pointers were extensions to C to allow the programmer to give hints to the compiler about how to implement a pointer in the horrific segmented memory architecture of the Intel 8086/8088 (and 80186) CPUs.  Those CPUs used two 16 bit registers (and variously sized offsets) to generate a 20-bit address.<br/>Near pointer is used to store 16 bit addresses means within current segment on a 16 bit machine. The limitation is that we can only access 64kb of data at a time. A far pointer is typically 32 bit that can access memory outside current segment. To use this, compiler allocates a segment register to store segment address, then another register to store offset within current segment. Huge pointer is also typically 32 bit and can access outside segment. In case of far pointers, a segment is fixed. In far pointer, the segment part cannot be modified, but in Huge it can be.</p>
