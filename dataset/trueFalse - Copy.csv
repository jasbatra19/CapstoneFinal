Threads within the same process can share data with one another by passing pointers to objects on their stacks.,TRUE
A user-level process cannot modify its own page table entries.,TRUE
"Immediately after a process has been forked, the same variable in both the parent and the child will have the same virtual memory address but different physical memory addresses.",FALSE
Hyper-threading refers to the situation in which a modern operating system allows thousands of threads to access the same address space.,FALSE
The scheduler is the part of an Operating System that determines the priority of each process.,FALSE
"The best way to correct virtual memory thrashing is to increase the overlap between I/O and computation, namely by increasing the number of runnable threads.",FALSE
Most PC operating systems do not support multi-programming.,FALSE
Threads in a process share same file descriptors.,TRUE
"In a modern operating system using memory protection through virtual memory, the hardware registers of a memory-mapped I/O device can only be accessed by the kernel.",FALSE
A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) can be used to call a procedure in another process on the same machine.,TRUE
The complexity of handling software TLB faults increases when exceptions are imprecise,TRUE
DMA is a mechanism for allowing an I/O device to transfer data to and from memory without involving the CPU in the transfer.,TRUE
Memory mapped I/O determines how the pages of an I/O-bound process are mapped to page frames.,FALSE
"There is only one MBR (master boot record) on a disk drive, but there could be several boot sectors.",FALSE
A context switch from one process to another can be accomplished without executing OS code in kernel mode.,FALSE
Multiple processes can correspond to the same program / executable file at the same time.,TRUE
The same process can correspond to multiple programs / executable files (not necessarily at the same time).,FALSE
Memory Mapped I/O devices are accessed with special instructions not used for normal computation.,FALSE
RAID-5 is 5 times more reliable than RAID-1.,FALSE
One advantage of a software TLB is that the same hardware platform can support both forward and inverse page tables.,TRUE
Compulsory misses in a cache can be reduced with prefetching.,TRUE
Non-volatile Ram (NVRAM) can improve the durability of a file system that uses delayed writes.,TRUE
A process in user mode cannot execute certain privileged hardware instructions.,TRUE
"A context switch can occur only after processing a timer interrupt, but not after any other system call or interrupt.",FALSE
Context-switching between threads of the same process requires flushing the TLB or tracking an ASID in the TLB.,FALSE
n advantage of implementing threads in user space is that they don't incur the overhead of having the OS schedule their execution.,TRUE
Deadlock can never occur if no process is allowed to hold a resource while requesting another resource.,TRUE
Two processes reading from the same virtual address will access the same contents,FALSE
"With dynamic relocation, hardware dynamically translates an address on every memory access.",TRUE
"A system that provides segmentation without paging can fragment the physical address space, forcing the operating system to waste physical memory.",TRUE
