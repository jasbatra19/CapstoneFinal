The process transitions from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state during resource allocation. This switching happens because the CPU may assign other processes precedence and substitute the currently active process for the higher priority process.']"
67) What is Non Pre Emptive Process Scheduling in Operating Systems?,"['In this case of Non Pre Emptive Process Scheduling, the resource cannot be withdrawn from a process before the process has finished running. When a running process finishes and transitions to the waiting state, resources are switched.']"
68) What is Context Switching?,"['Context switching is a technique or approach that the operating system use to move a process from one state to another so that it can carry out its intended function using system CPUs.', 'When a system performs a switch, it maintains the status of the previous operating process in the form of registers and allots the CPU to the new process to carry out its operations.', 'The old process must wait in a ready queue while a new one is running in the system. At the point when another process interrupted it, the old process resumes execution.', 'It outlines the features of an operating system that supports numerous workloads at once without the use of extra processors by allowing several processes to share a single CPU.']"
69) What is the use of Dispatcher in Operating Systems?,"['After the scheduler completes the process scheduling, a unique application called a dispatcher enters the picture.

80) What is Address Translation in Paging?,"['Logical and physical memory addresses, both of which are distinct, are the two types of memory addresses that are employed in the paging process. The logical address is the address that the CPU creates for each page in the secondary memory, but the physical address is the actual location of the frame where each page will be allocated. We now require a technique known as address translation carried out by the page table in order to translate this logical address into a physical address.']"
