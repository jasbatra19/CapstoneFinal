question,answer
What is an operating system?,The operating system is a software program that facilitates computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software.
What is the main purpose of an operating system?,It is designed to make sure that a computer system performs well by managing its computational activities.It provides an environment for the development and execution of programs.
What are the different operating systems?,"Batched operating systems,Distributed operating systems,Timesharing operating systems,Multi-programmed operating systems,Real-time operating systems
"
What is a socket?,A socket is used to make connection between two applications. Endpoints of the connection are called socket.
What is a real-time system?,Real-time system is used in the case when rigid-time requirements have been placed on the operation of a processor. It contains a well defined and fixed time constraints.
What is kernel?,Kernel is the core and most important part of a computer operating system which provides basic services for all parts of the OS.
What is monolithic kernel?,A monolithic kernel is a kernel which includes all operating system code is in single executable image.
What do you mean by a process?,An executing program is known as process
What is the difference between micro kernel and macro kernel?,Micro kernel: micro kernel is the kernel which runs minimal performance affecting services for operating system. In micro kernel operating system all other operations are performed by processor.Macro Kernel: Macro Kernel is a combination of micro and monolithic kernel.
What is the difference between process and program?,A program while running or executing is known as a process.
What is the use of paging in operating system?,Paging is used to solve the external fragmentation problem in operating system. This technique ensures that the data you need is available as quickly as possible.
What is the concept of demand paging?,"Demand paging specifies that if an area of memory is not currently being used, it is swapped to disk to make room for an application's need."
What is the advantage of a multiprocessor system?,"As many as processors are increased, you will get the considerable increment in throughput. It is cost effective also because they can share resources. So, the overall reliability increases."
What is virtual memory?,Virtual memory is a very useful memory management technique which enables processes to execute outside of memory. This technique is especially used when an executing program cannot fit in the physical memory.
What is thrashing?,"Thrashing is a phenomenon in virtual memory scheme when the processor spends most of its time in swapping pages, rather than executing instructions."
What is a thread?,"A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization. It consists of a thread ID, program counter, register set and a stack"
What is FCFS?,"FCFS stands for First Come, First Served. It is a type of scheduling algorithm. In this scheme, if a process requests the CPU first, it is allocated to the CPU first. Its implementation is managed by a FIFO queue."
What is deadlock? Explain,Deadlock is a specific situation or condition where two processes are waiting for each other to complete so that they can start. But this situation causes hang for both of them
Why Bankers algorithm used,To avoid deadlocks
What is the difference between logical address space and physical address space?,Logical address space specifies the address that is generated by CPU. On the other hand physical address space specifies the address that is seen by the memory unit.
What is fragmentation?,Fragmentation is a phenomenon of memory wastage. It reduces the capacity and performance because space is used inefficiently.
What is a binary Semaphore?,Binary semaphore takes only 0 and 1 as value and used to implement mutual exclusion and synchronize concurrent processes.
What is starvation in Operating System?,"Starvation is Resource management problem. In this problem, a waiting process does not get the resources it needs for a long time because the resources are being allocated to other processes."
What is aging in Operating System?,Aging is a technique used to avoid the starvation in resource scheduling system.
When does trashing occur?,Thrashing specifies an instance of high paging activity. This happens when it is spending more time paging instead of executing.
